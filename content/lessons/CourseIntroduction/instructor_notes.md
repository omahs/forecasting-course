## Introductions

	* Ecology hasn't historically done this well
	* Need to study dynamics in order to understand this
	* Need to learn how to work with dynamic data
	* Learn from other fields dealing with similar problems
* Students
    * Introduce yourself
    * Tell us what do you hope to get out of the class

## How the course will run

* Mix of paper discussion & R tutorials
* Discussion
